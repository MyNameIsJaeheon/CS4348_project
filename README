This is essentially a file-based database with B-Tree indexing.
The program:
  Interacts with the user through a command-line menu.
  Performs disk I/O to manage the indexed file.
  Implements the B-Tree algorithm to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.


Main.py:
  Create an Index File:
  A new file with a header block that includes metadata (e.g., root location, next free block).

  Open an Index File:
  Load an existing file, validating its format using a predefined "magic number."

  Insert Key-Value Pairs:
  Add a new pair to the B-Tree, splitting nodes if necessary.
  Ensure duplicate keys are not allowed.

  Search for a Key:
  Locate a specific key in the B-Tree and return its associated value.

  Load from a File:
  Bulk insert key-value pairs from a CSV file.

  Print All Data:
  Display all key-value pairs in the B-Tree.

  Extract Data:
  Save all key-value pairs in the B-Tree to a CSV file.

  Quit the Program:
  Exit the menu-driven interface.
